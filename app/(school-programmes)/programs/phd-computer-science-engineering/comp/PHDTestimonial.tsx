      <p>
        The program's flexibility allowed me to tailor my research to align with
        my interests, while the supportive faculty provided guidance every step
        of the way. The collaborative research culture and highly modern
        facilities helped me to discover the ever-evolving field of computer
        science. Iâ€™ll always be thankful to my teachers and this university who
        helped me to become CSE professional.
