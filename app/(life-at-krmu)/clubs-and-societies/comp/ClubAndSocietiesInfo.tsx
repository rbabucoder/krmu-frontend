            Clubs and societies offer students opportunities to engage in
            extracurricular activities, explore their interests, develop new
            skills, and build a sense of community. Participation in clubs and
            societies plays significant importance for students, contributing to
            their personal, academic, and professional growth. Students can hone
            leadership, teamwork, communication, organizational, and time
            management skills by taking on various roles within the club.
