            The <strong>Red Cross Society</strong>, founded on the principles of
            humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service,
            unity, and universality, shares a mission in fostering selfless
            service and community welfare. The{" "}
            <strong>Red Cross Society</strong> encourages the spirit of empathy
            and service among volunteers, particularly students and young
            individuals, by engaging them in activities that promote the welfare
            of the entire community.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Red Cross Society’s motto, “Promoting Health, Serving Humanity
            ,” emphasizes humanitarian values, encouraging individuals to
            prioritize the well-being of others above personal interests. The
            society provides students with opportunities to enhance their
            personalities and develop leadership and organizational skills while
            serving society. The Red Cross Society aims to nurture compassion
            and social responsibility through initiatives such as healthcare
            camps, blood donation drives, and awareness campaigns.
          </p>

            The Red Cross Society’s symbol, the Red Cross, on a white
            background, is a globally recognized emblem of protection and aid.
            It represents hope, care, and support in times of crisis, much like
            the Roth wheel of the Konark Sun Temple, which symbolizes the
            continuous cycle of life and the unending spirit of service.
