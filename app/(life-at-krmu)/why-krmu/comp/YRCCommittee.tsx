          YOUTH RED CROSS COMMITTEE @ KRMU, GURUGRAM
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Youth Red Cross (YRC) programs are a vital part of the strategic
          vision of the Indian Red Cross Society. These programs recognize and
          harness young peopleâ€™s diverse and significant roles as innovators,
          cultural ambassadors, peer educators, community mobilizers, or
          advocates for change. Youth Red Cross members are seen as catalysts
          for change, working tirelessly to support vulnerable communities. When
          collaborating with older generations, they bring fresh ideas and
          energy, fostering an environment of mutual respect and cooperation.
          This interaction between generations promotes the exchange of
          knowledge and skills, with experienced Red Cross volunteers offering
          valuable mentorship. This synergy is essential for nurturing the next
          generation of leaders today.

          At K.R. Mangalam University, the Youth Red Cross has been established
          to inspire young students with a passion for serving society. The
          primary goal is to instill in them the core values of the Red Cross,
          fostering a spirit of selfless service and volunteerism. By training
          zealous young students in the fundamental principles of the Red Cross,
          the program ensures that they remain resilient and motivated to serve
          vulnerable communities locally and globally. YRC at K.R Mangalam
          University carries out its social mission under the framework of the
          seven fundamental principles of the Red Cross: Humanity, Impartiality,
          Neutrality, Independence, Voluntary Service, Unity, and Universality.
