            The Motto of NSS – Not Me, But You, reflects the essence of
            democratic living and selfless service. It also explains that the
            welfare of an individual depends upon the welfare of the society as
            a whole, therefore, the NSS volunteers shall strive for the
            well-being of society. NSS helps students develop a tolerant and
            liberal approach to respecting difference in opinions.
