          Securing at least one job for every student will always remain a
          priority for the centre, therefore some restrictions have been
          proposed. They are as under
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students who have already been selected by two employers will have
            to wait to appear for more recruitment processes till most of their
            batch mates get a fair chance. The Head of the CDC, however, is
            authorized to use discretion in some cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this regard, a student would be considered selected if his/her
            name features in the final list of successful candidates. In case it
            features on the waiting list, he/she will be allowed to apply and
            appear for the recruitment of other companies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students getting an offer letter from two or more recruiters will
            have to decide upon one before completing their programme and inform
            the others accordingly through the Career Development Center.
