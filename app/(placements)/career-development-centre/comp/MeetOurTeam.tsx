              As the Director of the Career Development Center at K.R. Mangalam
              University, Gurugram, Delhi NCR, it is my privilege to extend a
              warm welcome. At K.R. Mangalam University, we are deeply committed
              to providing quality education and preparing industry-ready
              graduates equipped with the skills needed to thrive in an
              ever-evolving corporate landscape. Our focus is on fostering the
              holistic growth and comprehensive development of our students.

            <br />
            <p>
              The Career Skills and Tech Skills departments regularly conduct
              sessions on emerging topics in soft skills and technical
              expertise. Initiatives such as bootcamps, summer and winter
              schools, profile-based training, and company-specific training
              programs form the core of our upskilling efforts. The CDC places a
              strong emphasis on building a solid foundation for students by
              offering advanced courses that enhance analytical and
              computational abilities.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We prioritise industry exposure through projects, excursions,
              internships, hands-on workshops, on-the-job training, and
              educational tours. These experiences ensure that our students are
              well-prepared to navigate real-world challenges and make
              meaningful contributions to their chosen fields.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On behalf of K.R. Mangalam University, it gives me great pleasure
              to invite companies to our campus for recruitment. We are
              confident that you will discover a talented, ambitious, and
              dynamic pool of young professionals ready to make a difference in
              your organisation.
