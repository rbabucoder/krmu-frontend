              The Career Development Center at K.R. Mangalam University is
              dedicated to empowering students with the skills, guidance, and
              opportunities needed to excel in today’s competitive job market.
              We bridge the gap between academia and industry by offering
              holistic career support throughout a student’s academic journey.
              The Career Development Center regularly arranges corporate visits,
              industrial tours, or interactions with professionals to expose
              students to the corporate culture. This helps them understand the
              expectations and dynamics of a corporate environment.
