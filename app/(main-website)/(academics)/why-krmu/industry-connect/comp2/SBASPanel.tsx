            Workshop on Digital Forensics
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-5 text-lg">
            The School of Basic and Applied Sciences, K.R. Mangalam University
            organised a workshop on “Digital Forensics: Awareness on Trends and
            Technology” for Forensic Science students. The session was led by
            Air Commodore R.N. Gaekwad (Retd.), Managing Director of Idyllics
            Futuristic Technologies (IFT), who shared expert insights on drone
            forensics and its role in cybercrime investigations.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-lg">
            Students gained practical exposure to drone components, forensic
            tools, and real-world applications, including legal admissibility
            and cyber threat mitigation. A live demonstration by IFT’s drone
            instructor and an interactive Q&A session enriched the learning
            experience.
