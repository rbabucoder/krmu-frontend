            Session on Our Earth, Our Responsibility
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-5 text-lg">
            The School of Agricultural Sciences (SOAS) organised an impactful
            session titled “Our Earth, Our Responsibility” aligned with
            Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action. The keynote
            speaker, Dr. C. M. Bhagat, Managing Director of Bhagat Farms, Sohna,
            shared insights on sustainable agricultural practices, including
            organic farming, composting, rainwater harvesting, and renewable
            energy. He emphasised the importance of small daily actions—like
            reducing plastic use and planting trees—as meaningful steps toward a
            healthier planet. The session featured engaging discussions on
            climate-resilient crops, organic certification, and youth leadership
            in climate action.
