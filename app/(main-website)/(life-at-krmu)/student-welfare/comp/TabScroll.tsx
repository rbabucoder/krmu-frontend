                    Unbiased guidance from experienced thought leaders is
                    paramount to navigate students efficiently to achieve what
                    they want. Mentors at KRMU indulge with the mentee to
                    identify their aspirations, learning requirements, and
                    interests individually. The system strengthens the bond
                    between teachers and students while helping them teach and
                    learn at their own pace. The training from the mentors helps
                    the students to choose a career path that can suit their
                    skills and interests. Effective mentoring begins with the
                    faculty and depends on the healthy relationship between
                    faculty and students.

                            Billiards is a game of precision, focus, and
                            finesse. It involves striking balls on a rectangular
                            table using a cue stick, aiming to pocket them with
                            skill and strategy. A billiards player must master
                            angles, spins, and the right amount of force to
                            excel in this sport. It sharpens the mind and
                            enhances hand-eye coordination, requiring intense
                            concentration and steady hands. Billiards is more
                            than just a game; it’s a test of patience,
                            calculation, and technique. It promotes strategic
                            thinking, spatial awareness, and mental discipline.
                            The club provides an opportunity to develop a keen
                            sense of anticipation and sharpen one's cognitive
                            skills while enjoying a relaxing yet competitive
                            sport.

                            of “Run & Chase”, which in its simple form involves
                            Chasing and touching a person. Like all Indian

                            Tennis is a sport of finesse, power, and endurance.
                            It demands a well-rounded skill set, combining
                            agility, balance, coordination, and mental
                            resilience. A tennis player must have a keen sense
                            of timing, control over strokes, and the ability to
                            strategize against an opponent’s strengths and
                            weaknesses. Tennis teaches discipline, patience, and
                            the importance of maintaining physical and mental
                            balance. It is a sport that builds cardiovascular
                            fitness, enhances reflexes, and fosters an
                            analytical mind.
