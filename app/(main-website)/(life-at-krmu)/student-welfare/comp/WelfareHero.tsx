            Student Welfare provides ample scope, opportunities, and facilities
            for the students’ all-around development of personality and
            leadership qualities. Here, all the activities are undertaken to
            promote opportunities for the youth to enhance their skills and
            talents to boost their confidence. Besides undertaking engagement
            activities regarding the facilitation of outcomes during and after
            the students’ pursuit of academic activities, the office acts as a
            channel of communication between the students and the university
            administration.
