            K.R. Mangalam Group: Pioneering Excellence in Education
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-5">
            The K.R. Mangalam legacy, encompassing a distinguished group of
            educational institutions including schools and the university is a
            testament to our enduring commitment to academic excellence and
            innovation. Our journey began with the establishment of our first
            school, marking the genesis of a vision to redefine educational
            standards. Since then, each institution under the K.R. Mangalam
            umbrella has been a milestone in our quest for educational
            excellence.

            Throughout our history, the K.R. Mangalam Group has been at the
            forefront of educational innovation, constantly evolving to meet the
            needs of a changing world. Our institutions are more than just
            places of learning; they are cradles of intellectual and personal
            growth, where students are encouraged to explore, innovate, and
            excel.
