            Central Instrumentation Facility (CIF) is an Integral part of K.R
            Mangalam University. CIF is a modern lab equipped with advanced
            analytical instruments such as FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared
            Spectrometer), UV-VIS (Double beam UV-visible spectrometer), LCR
            meter, DSC/TGA/DTA etc. It provides vital support for research and
            educational activities, allowing users from different Institutes and
            Industries to access these sophisticated tools and ensures that the
            facility’s resources are available to a broad range of researchers
            and students. The CIF endeavors to foster scientific innovation and
            enhance the quality of research.
