            K R Mangalam University maintains its own comprehensive data
            repository encompassing all its publications, spanning journal
            articles, patents, books, and book chapters. Faculty members
            responsible for these publications personally upload their details
            onto our research application. Moreover, the application also
            facilitates the submission of reimbursement requests for conference
            registrations, fees for workshops, seminars, and memberships.
            Additionally, it serves as a platform for managing in-house
            conferences and both applied and granted projects.
