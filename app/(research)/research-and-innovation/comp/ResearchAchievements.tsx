The published report provides a structured method for ranking pathogens based on their probability of causing epidemics or pandemics. This framework will aid researchers and policymakers in allocating resources effectively for preparedness and response. By identifying high-risk pathogens, the framework aims to guide research efforts towards preventing, detecting, and controlling future outbreaks.",
