              Greetings from Team Research & Development of (RDC) Cell
            </strong>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In recent past, there is a marked change in global environment where
            the capacity to innovate and commercialize new high-tech products
            has taken the shape of a distributed global network. Sensing this
            pulse, India has recognized the strategic and economic importance of
            competitiveness and knowledge economy. India strives to be
            ‘Vishwaguru’ and to be placed in top three Economic leaders of
            World. Knowledge and only knowledge through innovations in every
            walk of life can be the sole path to achieve this Goal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>

            challenge and contribute significantly for development of Society as
